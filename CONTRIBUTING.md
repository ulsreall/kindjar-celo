## Guidelines

- Keep the frontend lightweight and mobile-first.
- Do not commit `.env`, private keys, `node_modules`, or build output.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes.
- Keep user-facing copy clear for non-technical MiniPay users.
- If adding wallet/contract features, include safety copy and transaction confirmation states.

## Good first issues

- Add campaign history from `Donated` events.
- Add campaign creation form for owner wallet.
- Add shareable campaign cards.
- Improve AI Agent prompts and scoring rules.
